  This TTP shows you how to use the change_directory action type
  to change the working directory for all future actions.  If you specify cleanup
  as default, the directory will be reverted during the cleanup phase.  This may
  be useful if any of your cleanups make assumptions about their working directory.
args:
  - name: cd_destination
    description: this argument is where we will try to cd to
    default: /tmp
steps:
  - name: "Initial directory"
    inline: |
      echo "Current working directory is: \"$(pwd)\""
  - name: "cd"
    cd: {{.Args.cd_destination}}
    cleanup: default
  - name: "New directory"
    inline: |
      echo "Current working directory is: \"$(pwd)\""
